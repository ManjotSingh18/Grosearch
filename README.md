# About
Searching for grocery across multiple websites has always been cumbersome due to redundant typing, and tabs cluttering the browser. Now is the time to simplify, and declutter. Welcome to Grosearch, a application with a powerful singular search able to traverse through several stores displaying popular products to users while focusing in on budgeting and low prices. Grosearch seeks to foster an enviornment where money and time is saved alongside stopping digital headaches. 

# Features
* Powerful singular search encompassing several retailers and products
* Easy to navigate graphical interface 
* Displays popular products sorted by lowest price by default
* Products formated graphically side-by-side emphasizing readability 
* Local host based only requiring outbound connections to authorized retailers

# Low Prices Guranteed
A glaring issue about the displayed products that may arise at first sight is the lack of personalized options for sorting. This was done by design as Grosearch seeks to focus on budgeting, and sorting features have been ommited as it is assumed users are seeking the lowest prices with less emphasis on other categories. Grosearch is catered towards students, and anyone else who is seeking to save money. 

# Partner Stores
The Stores have been selected based upon accessibility. The communications with Walamrt is established by uttilization of their Application Programming Interface. Alternatively the communications with Sprouts, CostCo, and Alberstons was established by scraping their publicly available data off their websites respectively. All rights are reserved to them, I do not seek personal monetary gain from this application. Links to retailer wesbites hosting the product have been provided if users are intrested in purchasing a displayed product.
